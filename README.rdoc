= computron

Computron is like ab on steroids, implemented in Ruby using em-http-request. It was designed out of a need to simulate real users on a website. It also does a few smart things like decode JSON into a Ruby hash so you can use those responses in your next requests.

= The DSL

Computron is a simple DLS around HTTP em that makes more sense to write user tests.
